# Seeing Through the Rock: Evaluating Bias and Uncertainty in Visual Mineral Estimation
This project idea emerged from reviewing numerous student assignment submissions in which they estimated mineral abundances in both hand samples and thin sections. This task is practically valuable because it helps students understand the potential biases and limitations of visual mineral identification, especially in field settings where thin sections and microscopes aren't available.  
**The main goals** of this project are to:   
1. Evaluate the extent to which students miscalculate major mineral abundances.  
1. Identify whether individuals have consistent biases â€” such as overestimating or underestimating specific minerals.
1. Detect common trends in misidentification across multiple students. 
1. Quantify the uncertainty in visual mineral estimation in hand samples compared to thin section analysis.

**The core dataset** consists of four slightly different granite samples and one dike  from southeastern Missouri. For each sample (hand sample and thin section), students provided visual estimates of the modal abundances of major minerals. These will be compared against a "true" dataset derived from 100-point manual point-count analysis of the corresponding thin sections. A secondary dataset will include estimates from a previous cohort of students. This may help to reveal whether instructional differences (e.g., different teachers) influence biases or whether the trends hold consistently across groups.  
_Pyrolite_ package was be used to illustrate patterns and discrepancies in mineral estimation on ternary plots.
